# ResearchChain

## Inspiration


## What it does
Our web application allows scientists from around the world to view, upload, and peer review scientific publications. As a decentralized web application, it would address many of the concerns of the scientific community by: 
1. Ensuring trust amongst the scientific community and with the public
2. Incentivizing & speeding up the review process
3. Reduced costs for publishing
4. Disseminating scientific knowledge across the world

## How we built it
Solidity, Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and bootstrap. 

## Challenges we ran into


## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned
We learned a tremendous amount about decentralized applications, blockchain technology, and the Solidity programming language.

## What's next
We would like to incorporate some additional functionality into the app. Several tools, such as: a parser to extract key document sections, ranking for community impact, and filtering when viewing manuscripts, all fit with our broader vision for the application.
